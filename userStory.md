# The Wisdom Center Website and API
This website appears to be a very tacky website dedicated to sharing banal quotes of wisdom. But upon further inspection, something feels off....

## Who
This project is to showcase my capabilities at making a MERN application, the exact aesthetic and theme of this site is more for amusement than anything overly specific.

## What
Upon entering the website the user will see a homepage with many tabs to click one, each one has interesting words of wisdom to share, and a dark secret hidden within....

## Why
This website was made for me to practice my means of utilizing the MERN system for making an app. The concept is simple, interesting, and particularly strange to make the app all the more fun to make.
